    /**
     * Promotes [JumpToSourceDiffAction] above `EditSource`-related actions to ensure correct shortcut handling.
     *
     * This method is invoked during action resolution when a shortcut is pressed. It adjusts the order of available
     * actions so that [JumpToSourceDiffAction] takes precedence over other actions using the same shortcut.
     *
     * This is necessary because platform actions like `Frontend.EditSource` (introduced in Rider 2025.1 â€”
     * see [action registration](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/abbd981/platform/vcs-impl/frontend/resources/intellij.platform.vcs.impl.frontend.xml#L53))
     * and `RiderEditSource` (in earlier Rider versions) are registered earlier in the action list and are
     * selected first during shortcut resolution, preventing our action from being invoked. Our action intentionally
     * reuses the `EditSource` shortcut, which is also used by these platform `EditSource`-related actions, making
     * it necessary to dynamically promote ours in the resolved action list to ensure it is invoked.
     *
     * This adjustment is performed using the [ActionPromoter] extension point rather than modifying keymap bindings.
     * Programmatic keymap modifications are avoided because they can unintentionally alter user configurations, are
     * fragile across IDE versions, and can cause issues during IDE startup. In particular, during the IDE's first load,
     * [com.intellij.openapi.keymap.KeymapManagerListener.activeKeymapChanged] is fired while
     * [com.intellij.openapi.keymap.KeymapManager] is still initializing; accessing keymap data at that point triggers
     * recursive initialization, resulting in an infinite loop (see [IJPL-5324](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-5324)).
     *
     * By reordering actions at runtime through [ActionPromoter], we avoid these pitfalls while ensuring correct
     * shortcut behavior in both existing and future IDE builds, even as additional `EditSource`-related actions are
     * introduced or renamed.
     *
     * Additionally, this method handles the case where the plugin is enabled dynamically after IDE startup. In such
     * cases, even though the shortcut may be registered correctly, the platform may not include
     * [JumpToSourceDiffAction] in the resolved action list. This prevents it from being triggered. To address this, the
     * method inserts the current action instance directly before the `EditSource` action if it is not already present
     * in the list, ensuring it participates in resolution and the shortcut remains functional.
     *
     * @param actions The list of available actions in the given [context].
     * @param context The current data context, used to determine the editor kind.
     * @return A reordered list with [JumpToSourceDiffAction] promoted, or the original list if no changes are needed.
